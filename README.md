# Animated-Website

This is a simple website with a few animations. It is made using HTML and JavaScript. With the help of AOS library, Tailwind CSS and some JavaScript, I have made this website.

## AOS Library

AOS is a library that helps you animate elements as you scroll down a page. It is easy to use and has a lot of features. You can check out the documentation [here](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/).

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It is easy to use and has a lot of features. You can check out the documentation [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).


## JavaScript

I have used JavaScript to make the navbar responsive. I have also used JavaScript to make the navbar sticky.
